## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

On this Practice App y learn the use of APIS 

css: I like this effect:

.advice--layout-loading {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 1rem 0;
  color: var(--advice-neon-green);
  animation-name: layoutLoading;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
}

@keyframes layoutLoading {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}


### Continued development

I'd like to continue develop on my React Hooks uses... i know the bery basics of it

### Useful resources
